    "Geometric, or matrix optics is a mathematical tool for modelling complex optical systems. It is a technique for **tracing rays**. Consider the optical system below. It is circularly symmetric and consists of a series of refracting surfaces all centered about the same axis - the **optical axis**. The $z$ axis lies along the optical axis.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/system.jpg\"  alt=\"optical_system\"  width=\"50%\"  height=\"100%\"  style=\"object-fit:cover\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A ray at point $z$ is completely described by two properties; its distance from the optical axis $y$ and the angle of the ray $\\theta$. The ray going into the optical system has position and direction $(y_1, \\theta_1)$ and the optical system bends the ray so it has an output position and direction $(y_2, \\theta_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we further assume that all the angles are small, so that $\\sin \\theta \\simeq \\theta$ then the relationship between $(y_1, \\theta_1)$ and $(y_2, \\theta_2)$ is **linear**, and we can write:\n",

    "\\theta_2 = C y_1 + D \\theta 1\n",

    "\n",
    "This can be re-written as a matrix equation and therefore any optical system can be written as a matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, so that:\n",

    "\n",
    "A ray travelling a distance $d$ in free space, or through a material of constant refractive index travels in a straight line, so $y_2 = y_1 + \\theta_1 d$ and $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$. This means that \n",

    "\n",
    "At a planar boundary between refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$, the ray angle changes according to Snell's law. $y$ does not change. For small angles, Snell's law is $n_1 \\theta_1 = n_2 \\theta_2$, so \n",

    "A table of ray-transfer matrices for simple optical components is given on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_transfer_matrix_analysis).\n",

    "## Complex Optical Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this technique is when modelling complex systems. Imagine a ray that starts at position $(y_0, \\theta_0)$. It then travels through free space with transfer matrix $\\mathbf{M_1}$, giving $(y_1, \\theta_1)$. Then  \n",
    " it passes through a refractive boundary $\\mathbf{M_2}$ to give  $(y_2, \\theta_2)$ and finally propagates in constant refractive index with transfer matrix $\\mathbf{M_2}$ to give $(y_3, \\theta_3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, \n",

    "$$(y_3, \\theta_3) = \\mathbf{M_2} (y_2, \\theta_2) = \\mathbf{M_2} \\mathbf{M_1} (y_1, \\theta_1) = \\mathbf{M_3} \\mathbf{M_2} \\mathbf{M_1} (y_0, \\theta_0) = \\mathbf{M_s} (y_0, \\theta_0),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{M_s} = \\mathbf{M_3} \\mathbf{M_2} \\mathbf{M_1}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, one can propagate a ray through a optical system of made of up $N$ individual components by treating it as if it were a single optical elemenr with transfer matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{M_N} \\mathbf{M_{N-1}} \\ldots \\mathbf{M_2} \\mathbf{M_1}$$\n",
