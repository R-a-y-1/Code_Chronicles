All code is tested where appropriate.\n|65-80%  |Code is correct. Tests are present, well described and correct, but incomplete.\n|55-65%  |Code is correct. Testing weak or absent.\n|10-55%  |Code runs, but incorrect results.\n|0-10%   |Code does not run.\n\n### Style (15%)\n|%       | Requirement\n|--------|------------\n|75-100% |Well designed, understandable, concise code. Uses functions, classes, inheritance, etc.\n|60-75%  |Well designed, clear code. Could use be more concise, or use more advanced language features.\n|40-60%  |OK design. Little use of functions etc. Hard to understand.\n|0-40%   |Incomprehensible/ \"spaghetti\" code. Hard to understand, needs multiple readings.\n\n### Comments and Explanations (15%)\n|%       | Requirement\n|--------|------------\n|75-100% |Complete, Concise, meaningful, well-formatted comments. Functions documented.\n|40-75%  |Partial,  poorly written, incorrect, confusing comments. \n|0-40%      |No comments at all.\n\n# Results (50/100)\n\n### Feature Engineering (5%)\n|%       | Requirement\n|--------|------------\n|75-100% |Feature engineering completed with care. All data issues dealt with.\n|50-75%  |Feature engineering completed with care. Some data issues remain.\n|0-50%   |Feature engineering minimal or absent.\n\n### Training Choices & Results (30%)\n|%       | Requirement\n|--------|------------\n|75-100% |Choices of hyperparameters well justified by systematic exploration of suitable metrics. Training performed with utmost care. Results presented with clarity and simplicity, using appropriate metrics.\n|60-75%  |Hyperparameters for classifiers chosen by a systematic method. Results for all classifiers compared. Some evidence for careful training. High accuracy.\n|40-60%  |Some evidence that different hyperparameters explored. Evidence that training didn't just use default settings. Reasonable results. Accuracies reasonable (70-80%).\n|0-40%   |Little or no exploration of hyperparameters. \n\n### Discussion (15%)\n|%       | Requirement\n|--------|------------\n|75-100% |A thorough discussion of results, including a correct discussion of why the choices made in feature engineering and training were appropriate. Some exploration of how the classifier has made its choices. A discussion of how the classification could be improved.\n|60-75%  |Results are discussed, with perhaps some misunderstandings about training or feature engineering. Discusses how classification can be improved.\n|40-60%  |Discussion of results is present and mostly correct. \n|0-40%   |Little or no discussion of results. Alternatively, many misunderstandings of training process and results.  ","pos":0,"type":"cell"}
